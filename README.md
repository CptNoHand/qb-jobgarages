# qb-jobgarages
Just a little script, so you can add garages to jobs like cardealers or maybe gangs.

As I don't have much knowledge in general, don't ask me for the creaziest support.
It's the first script I made by myself.

works with the newest QB-Version and is plug and play. 

Also I'm open to your pull requests so even I can learn a bit more.
